1. podman run <image name>
    we use -d to run container in background (detached mode).
    but if we didn't used it then when we press ctrl + C it will kill process and container also.
    So, to not kill container we have to use -d.

2. podman ps
    displayes id and names of all activity running containers.
    we can give container a name but if we havent then it can take default name.
    to give a container name use --name and give name of container.

    eg: sudo podman run --name <container_name> <image_name>

3. the name of podman must be unique always.

4. podman ps -a
    will display all activity of running and stopped containers.
